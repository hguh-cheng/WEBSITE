  <p>
    In this game, Archibald and Cookie Monster play a game that involves his true
    favorite dessert–a bar of chocolate. In the beginning of the game, the bar
    of chocolate is a perfect rectangle. On any turn, a player picks a square of
    the chocolate and eats all squares above and/or to the right of it. The
    player who eats the bottom left square loses, as it is poisoned. For
    example, the following is a valid first move.

    Zermelo’s Theorem tells us that one player has a strategy to win. As a simple case, identify the winning player and strategy if the chocolate bar begins as a perfect square.

            The first player has the winning strategy by chomping out a square such that two equally long one-square spires are left:

        <p>Note that this essentially reduces to the two-pile game of Nim.</p>
        <p>It turns out that the general strategy for Chomp is unknown. Computers can play perfectly by brute force, but this is unfeasible for large chocolate bars as the number of possible game states grows exponentially.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to prove that player who chomps first always has a winning strategy on every nontrivial bar, even without knowing what the strategy is. Try it out yourself.</p>
        <p>Hint: <span class="spoiler">Suppose by contradiction that on some starting bar, no matter what initial move the first player makes, the second player has a winning strategy.</span></p>

                Suppose by contradiction that on some starting bar, no matter what initial move the first player makes, the second player has a winning strategy. Then, consider the position in which the first player removes the single upper right square, like so:

            <p>
                As the second player, observe that any possible move in this game state would have been possible to make as the first player. Since we assume that the second player must have a winning strategy as a follow-up to this move, then it must have been possible for the first player to win by using the second player’s strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, although we still don’t know what the strategy for the first player is, we have proven that it is always possible for them to guarantee a win. This argument is known as the <b>strategy stealing argument.</b> As an exercise, try to apply this argument to prove that the second player can never guarantee a win in tic-tac-toe.
