  <h1>Combinatorial Games</h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    This chapter hardly relates to any of the previous games. Rather, these
    turn-based, zero-sum combinatorial games align more closely with what most
    people would associate with games (the likes of Chess, Connect 4, etc.).
    They are a subset of sequential games, but too complicated to analyze with a
    sequential tree diagram.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, consider <b>Zermelo’s Theorem</b> (the proof of which is beyond the
    scope of this website), which states that either the first player can
    guarantee a win, the second player can guarantee the win, or both players
    can guarantee a draw for games satisfying the following criteria:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>There are two players that take turns making moves.</li>
    <li>There are finitely many possible moves.</li>
    <li>
      Each player has perfect knowledge of the other player’s possible moves.
    </li>
    <li>There is no element of chance.</li>
    <li>The game must always terminate in a finite number of moves.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the following games, we’ll try to analyze strategies for guaranteeing a
    win or loss. I apologize for dropping the plot, but hopefully the
    interesting information about to be presented will allow you to forgive me.
