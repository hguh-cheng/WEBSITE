  <h1>Tabletop</h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    Archibald and Cookie Monster take turns placing perfectly circular cookies on a
    perfectly square table. Once placed, cookies cannot be moved. Cookies cannot
    overlap with other cookies, and must fit fully on the table. The last player
    to place a cookie on the table wins.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that we cannot apply Zermeloâ€™s Theorem, because the number of possible
    states of the board is infinite. If Archibald goes first, is there a winning
    strategy?

      We can apply a similar strategy as the previous games of mirroring the
      opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, start by placing a cookie in the middle of the table. Then,
      whatever Cookie Monster does, reflect his move across the center of the
      board. Due to the perfect symmetry maintained by Archibald's moves, then if
      Cookie Monster ever has a move to play, there will be an open spot on the
      opposite side of the board. This is because once a cookie is placed in the
      center, any two points that are reflected across the center have greater
      distance than one diameter of a cookie, which makes it impossible for any
      single cookie to cover two points that are reflected over the center.
