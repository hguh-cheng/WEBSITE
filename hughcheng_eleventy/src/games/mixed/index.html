    <h1>Mixed Equilibria</h1>
    <br />

    <p>In this chapter, we expand the range of possible actions that a player can take. Rather than committing to a single action (in a pure strategy), players can now use <b>mixed strategies</b> where they assign a probability to each action. Essentially, they commit to a probabilistic distribution of actions.</p>

    <div class="notation-box">
        <p>We can formalize this concept of a <b>mixed strategy</b> with some notation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Let $\alpha_i$ (an alpha, not an a) represent a mixed strategy profile.</li>
            <li>Let $\alpha_i(a_i)$ represent player $i$’s mixed strategy, a function that assigns a probability to each pure strategy $a_i.$
                <ul>
                    <li>For convenience like before, $\alpha_{-i}$ denotes ever other player’s mixed strategy.</li>
                    <li>For convenience, we can express $\alpha_i$ as an ordered list of probabilities that correspond to actions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Let $U_i(\alpha)$ (with a capital U) represent the expected payoff, or <b>Bernoulli payoff</b> function for player $i$ of the mixed strategy profile $\alpha.$ Symbolically, it is defined as $$U_i(\alpha) = \sum_{a_i \in A_i} \alpha_i (a_i) E(a_i, a_{-i}),$$ where $E(a_i, \alpha_{-i})$ represents the expected payoff for player $i$ if they play pure strategy $a_i$ and everyone else plays the mixed profile $\alpha_{-i}.$</li>
        </ul>
        These variable names are somewhat standard and will be followed throughout the website.

    In the coming chapters, we explore some scenarios where mixed equilibria arise to motivate this unintuitive concept.
