  <p><b>Game theory</b> is the mathematical analysis of decisions.</p>

  <p>
    The goal of this website is to provide a brief exposition of game theory
    through various examples, exercises, and interactives. If you have no prior
    knowledge in game theory, then I'd recommend going through the
    <b>Pure Equilibria</b> and <b>Mixed Equilibria</b> chapters in order.
    However, the <b>Combinatorial Games</b> chapter is self-contained, so feel
    free to skip to there first.

    Sometimes, there will be exercises that I encourage you to think about before moving on. So, some content will be initially hidden. Try revealing the remaining content on this page.

      There are sections with heavy notation, but for the most part, they are
      not necessary to understand the bigger picture (but they do help formalize these concepts). Such sections will be
      marked by notation boxes like this one.
    </p>
    <div class="notation-box">
      <p>Symbolically,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let \( S \) denote the set of all sections in this website.</li>
        <li>
          Let \( N \subset S \) denote the subset of sections with heavy notation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let \( f : S \rightarrow \{0, 1\} \) be an indicator function such that
          \[ f(s) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } s \text{ is necessary for the big picture} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, I claim that \( \forall s \in N, f(s) = 0. \)</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      I got a little carried away with the creative writing aspect of this
      project. Although the plot is unnecessary for understanding game theory,
      you may find it helpful to motivate your learning.

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
