        The goal of this website is to provide a brief exposition of game theory
        through various interactives. If you have no prior knowledge, then I'd
        recommend going through the "pure" and "mixed" chapters in order.
        However, the "combinatorial" chapter is self-contained, so feel free to
        skip to there first.

        I got a little carried away with the creative writing aspect of this
        project. Most of the plot is unnecessary for learning game theory, but
        you may find it helpful to motivate your learning.

        There are sections with heavy notation, but for the most part, they are
        not necessary to understand the bigger picture.

      <p>Enjoy!</p>
