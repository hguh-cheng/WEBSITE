  <h1>Coordination</h1>
  <br />
  <p>
    The next day in Cookie Monster’s Fungeon, the rules of the game are
    different. Generous as he is, he’s identified your and Bartholomew’s
    favorite cookies: you crave butter cookies, and Bartholomew yearns for the
    snickerdoodle.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rules of the game are simple; both you and Bartholomew must pick between
    <b>butter cookies</b> or <b>snickerdoodles.</b> If you both pick the same
    cookie, you will both receive one of that cookie. However, if you pick
    different cookies, neither of you will receive anything for today. Both of
    you would prefer to eat your favorite cookie, but would rather eat any
    cookie than no cookie.
  </p>

  <p>
    Construct a payoff matrix that represents this game and find the game’s Nash
    equilibria.

          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>Butter Cookie</th>
            <td>
              <div class="outcome">2, 1</div>

              <div class="outcome">0, 0</div>
            </td>
            <td>
              <div class="outcome">1, 2</div>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      For our current purposes, the exact payoffs don’t matter, as they don’t
      affect the player preferences. Just make sure that for each player,
      receiving their favorite cookie rewards a higher payoff than the other
      cookie, which rewards a higher payoff than receiving no cookie (and both
      cases in which the player receives no cookie should reward the same
      payoff).
    </p>

    <p>
      The Nash equilibria of this game are when both players choose the same
      cookie. For these outcomes, neither of you can strictly benefit from
      deviating because you would receive no cookies.

      <p>
        Neither strategy is strictly dominated, so it’s impossible to tell with
        100% certainty what Bartholomew’s plan was beforehand. If only there were
        a way to coordinate. Actually, why didn’t you? You should have just
        talked to him. How foolish of you not to consider options that weren’t
        presented!
      </p>

      <p>From this game, you discover two new facts about Nash equilibria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A game can have multiple Nash equilibria.</li>
        <li>
          It may be helpful to collude with other players to achieve a Nash
          equilibrium. Such games are known as <b>coordination games.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        In game theory, this game is known as the <b>Battle of the Sexes</b> (or
        Bach or Stravinsky, another acronym for "BoS"), where the premise is
        coordinating a date.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coordination games may come in the form of colluding to determine a Nash
        Equilibrium (like BoS). They may also come in the form of colluding to
        settle on one Nash equilibrium over another.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in the <b>Stag Hunt</b> game, a group of $N$ players each
        have two options: hunt a stag, or hunt a hare. Hunting a hare rewards a
        payoff of $1.$ Hunting a stag rewards a payoff of $2,$ but only if every
        single player hunts the stag. Note that if there is a mix of stag
        hunters and hare hunters, then all stag hunters would regret not hunting
        a hare. So, the only Nash equilibria of this game are when all players
        hunt the stag, or all players hunt a hare. With coordination, the
        players can choose the more preferable Nash Equilibrium.
