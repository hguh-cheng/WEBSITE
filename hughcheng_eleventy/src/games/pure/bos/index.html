    <h1>Coordination</h1>
    <br />
    <p>The next day in Cookie Monster’s Fungeon, the rules of the game are different. Generous as he is, he’s identified your and Bartholomew’s favorite cookies: you crave snickerdoodles, and Bartholomew yearns for butter cookies.</p>

    <p>The rules of the game are simple; both you and Bartholomew must pick between <b>snickerdoodles</b> and <b>butter cookies.</b> If you both pick the same cookie, you will both receive one of that cookie. However, if you pick different cookies, neither of you will receive anything for today. Both of you would prefer to eat your favorite cookie, but would rather eat any cookie than no cookie.</p>

    <p>Construct a payoff matrix that represents this game and find the game’s Nash equilibria.</p>
