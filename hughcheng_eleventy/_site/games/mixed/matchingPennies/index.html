  <h1>An Impossible Choice</h1>
  <br />

  <p>You can barely make out your surroundings.</p>

  <p><i>Where am I?</i> You ask the void.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Glooooooooooorb,</i> the alien replies. Something about your hopeless
    expression reveals to it that you didn’t understand, so the alien sticks a
    small fish in your ear and repeats themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i
      >Hello, Archibald. I am Beezleglorb. If you wish to return home, play
      games with me. You better be good at them, too.</i
    >
  </p>
  <p>Good thing you’re no stranger to games.</p>
  <p>
    Beezleglorb lays out the rules of their first game. In front of both of you
    are two buttons, colored neon brown and seafoam green. The room is
    constructed in such a way so that neither of you can see which button the
    opposing player presses. If you choose different colors, you owe Beezleglorb
    one dollar. If you choose the same color, Beezleglorb owes you one glorbuck
    (which converts to one US dollar).
  </p>
  <p>
    Try to model the game with a payoff matrix and find any Nash equilibria.

    <p>
      After constructing the payoff matrix, you realize that with the tools
      you’re aware of, you can’t find any Nash equilibria that may inform your
      decision. Your best bet is to consider if Beezleglorb is more likely to
      choose one color over the other. After closely examining their alien face,
      however, you realize it’s indecipherable. It doesn’t really matter what
      you do; Beezleglorb might as well be choosing their color at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, your hand hovers over the green button. After all, seafoam green is
      your favorite color. In fact, it’s all you’re wearing; your blazer,
      trousers, rainboots, and monocles are all colored seafoam green.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you get an eerie feeling that you’re being watched closely. It’s
      Beezleglorb, who’s been analyzing your appearance as much as you’ve been
      attempting to analyze theirs. And based on everything they know about you,
      you’re probably going to pick seafoam green. As soon as you realize this,
      Beezleglorb smiles. They’re reading you like a book, knowing you’re
      planning to switch to neon brown last minute! You’re not sure how you
      know, but every time you even think about switching buttons, Beezleglorb
      can tell. No matter what, Beezleglorb will be one logical step ahead. It’s
      hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, you think of a brilliant strategy. You pick up the dollar coin
      you were nearly going to kiss goodbye to. That’s right–your choice will be
      decided by a coin toss. After all, if you don’t know what you’re doing,
      then Beezleglorb can’t.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a new option you’ve never even considered before. Your strategies
      don’t have to be “pick seafoam green” or “pick neon brown.” A third option
      can be “pick seafoam green or neon brown with 50% probability.” Actually,
      there are infinitely many probabilistic distributions you can assign to
      the two buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we describe these options with Nash equilibria? Instead of
      calculating preferences over the action profiles, we compare expected
      payoffs. In this game, suppose both you and Beezleglorb “mix” your
      strategies with probability 50%. Then, we have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>25% chance of (Green, Green), for a payoff of +1</li>
      <li>25% chance of (Green, Brown), for a payoff of -1</li>
      <li>25% chance of (Brown, Green), for a payoff of -1</li>
      <li>25% chance of (Brown, Brown), for a payoff of +1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Which grants an expected payoff of $0.$ Symmetrically, Beezleglorb has an
      expected payoff of $0.$ This expected payoff function is called the
      <b>Bernoulli Payoff Function,</b> which we can treat very similarly to the
      normal payoff function. Preferences over deterministic action profiles are
      called Von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences (<b>vNM preferences</b> for
      short).
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose you pick brown with probability $p$ and green with probability
      $1-p,$ and Beezleglorb picks brown with probability $q$ and green with
      probability $1-q.$ As Beezleglorb's $q$ varies, what are the best
      responses for $p$?
    </p>
    <div class="reveal-divider" data-target="section2">
      <div class="reveal-text">Reveal Answer</div>
      <div class="reveal-line"></div>
      <div class="reveal-arrow"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="permanent-line"></div>
    <div id="section2" class="content-section">
      <p>
        Note that if $q \neq \frac{1}{2},$ which means that Beezleglorb has a
        slight preference towards one of the colors, then your best response is
        to pick the same color 100% of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if $q = \frac{1}{2},$ then it doesn’t really matter what you
        do, so any choice of $p$ is a best response.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the only equilibrium is when both players assign equal probability to the colors. In this sense, there actually is a Nash Equilibrium. However, note that it is a weak Nash equilibrium, as any mixed strategy is the best response. This turns out to be true of any Nash equilibrium involving mixed strategies.</p>
      <div class="notation-box">
        <p>Symbolically, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is therefore defined as a mixed strategy profile $\alpha*$ such that for each player $i,$ we have $$U_i(\alpha_i*, \alpha_{-i}*) \ge U_i(\alpha_i, \alpha_{-i}*)$$ for all possible mixed strategies $\alpha_i.$ This is practically identical to the definition for a pure Nash equilibrium.
        </p>
    </div>
        <p>
            Mixed strategies have various interpretations. In this game, they can represent probabilistic distributions over pure strategies. They can also represent the distribution of pure strategies within a population.
        </p>
        <p>You glance up at Beezleglorb and flip the coin out of their sight. Frustrated, they select a button a random, and so do you. You win.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beezleglorb demands thousands of rematches. Ultimately, you win approximately 50% of them. You will sleep well tonight with a net loss of around zero dollars.
